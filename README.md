# Say-No-To-Notes

Hey There..ðŸ‘‹ tried of taking boring notes, is'nt it ? I got you.
This is a simple piece of code that takes audio notes.

## Working
* clone my repo. 
* install the requirements from [requirements.txt](https://github.com/itsatulya/Say-No-To-Notes/blob/6cc9d6739c40d96f14ba0e604c2202431db1132f/requirements.txt) if needed. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* run the [Selfnote.py](https://github.com/itsatulya/Say-No-To-Notes/blob/6cc9d6739c40d96f14ba0e604c2202431db1132f/Selfnotes.py).
* whenever you take a break while speaking the code will register it as a line with its time stamp.
* to view the notes you can access it from the designated csv file, here [notes.csv](https://github.com/itsatulya/Say-No-To-Notes/blob/6cc9d6739c40d96f14ba0e604c2202431db1132f/notes.csv)

## Additionals
* Problems in installing **pyaudio**, you can download the .whl file [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio) and install it.
* Ensure that you have a stable network connection so that the recognition and conversion is uninterupted.
* if you don't want the notes in the csv then simply change the file extension in the [Selfnote.py](https://github.com/itsatulya/Say-No-To-Notes/blob/6cc9d6739c40d96f14ba0e604c2202431db1132f/Selfnotes.py) and the same goes for file name.
* if you want to remove time stamps then simply comment **line 21** in [Selfnote.py](https://github.com/itsatulya/Say-No-To-Notes/blob/6cc9d6739c40d96f14ba0e604c2202431db1132f/Selfnotes.py).

**Thank You**
